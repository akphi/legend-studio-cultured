  // This is a `Solution Style` tsconfig that really does nothing but manage other project files.
  // In a sense, a solution project is a composite project with references to other projects, but no files of its own.
  // See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html#support-for-solution-style-tsconfigjson-files
  //
  // Here, none of these tsconfig.*.json files get picked up by the server,
  // but weâ€™d really like the language server to understand that the current .ts file
  // probably belongs to one of the mentioned projects in this tsconfig.json.
  //
  // In other words, this will prevent an incorrect invocation of `tsc` without `--build` from
  // trying to build the entire packages folder source files as one compilation
  // (which will fail, but drop a bunch of .js files in random places as an annoying side effect).
